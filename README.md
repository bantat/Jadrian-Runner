**Running/Building the Game:**

- We made an error in the .iml file at the "phase_3_3" tag. This was corrected on 6/9 in tag "phase_3_3_b", and the only difference with that tag is that the .iml file is corrected. 

- Import the project in intelliJ from existing files, using JDK 1.8.

- Make sure the language level is set to 8 to account for lambdas and method references.

- If problem with junit import for test files, click lightbulb next to @Test and choose Import JUnit to Classpath

- Run Main.java in intelliJ

Hope you enjoy the game!
